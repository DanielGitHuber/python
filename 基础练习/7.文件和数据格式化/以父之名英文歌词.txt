The cool morning dew wets the black dress

Foggy on the stone road, my father whispers

Helpless awakening can only be more cruel

Everything is for the way to the church

The lingering fog conceals the intention

Who paces gently and stops

The bullet passing through before crying takes away the temperature

Each of us is guilty

Guilty of different sins

I can decide who is right

Who should be sleeping

The dispute cannot be resolved

In the never ending night

Shut your mouth

The only favor

Those who stand in front are guilty

There is no way to regret it

Judgment in the name of the father

It feels like there is no suitable vocabulary

It's like crying while laughing

Staring at the complete black

The tragedy that prevents the tragedy from spreading will make me intoxicated

Lower your head and kiss my left hand

In exchange for the promise of forgiveness

Old pipe organ in the corner

Have been accompaniment all the time

The black curtain was blown by the wind

Sunlight penetrates silently

Sprinkle to the group of beasts that I have tamed

Yell in silence yell in silence

Lonely starts to ferment

Keep laughing at me

Memories are gradually burning

Once innocent picture

Appear cruelly and tenderly

Fragile time

Let's pray together

Benevolent father i have fallen

The kingdom of invisible sin

Please forgive my arrogance

Ah ya ya check it check it ah ya

No one can say no one can say

So unbearable

Behind the glory is carved a loneliness

Ah ya ya check it check it ah ya

I close my eyes and see again

The picture of that dream back then

The sky is misty fog

Ah ya ya check it check it ah ya

Father holding my hands

Walk gently

The quiet stone road in the early morning

Ah ya ya check it check it ah ya

Pie Jesu

Qui tollis peccata

Dona eis requiem

Lower your head and kiss my left hand

In exchange for a promise of forgiveness

Old pipe organ in the corner

Have been accompaniment all the time

The black curtain was blown by the wind

Sunlight penetrates silently

Sprinkle to the group of beasts that I have tamed

Yell in silence yell in silence

Lonely starts to ferment

Keep laughing at me

Memories are gradually burning

Once innocent picture

Appear cruelly and tenderly

Fragile time

Let's pray together

Benevolent father i have fallen

The kingdom of invisible sin

Please forgive my arrogance

Ah ya ya check it check it ah ya

No one can say no one can say

So unbearable

Behind the glory is carved a loneliness

Ah ya ya check it check it ah ya

Benevolent father i have fallen

The kingdom of invisible sin

Please forgive me my arrogance

Engraved with a loneliness

Benevolent father i have fallen

The kingdom of invisible sin

Please forgive my arrogance

Ah ya ya check it check it ah ya

No one can say no one can say

So unbearable

Behind the glory is carved a loneliness

Ah ya ya check it check it ah ya

I close my eyes and see again

The picture of that dream back then

The sky is misty fog

The owl is looking into the distance on the window lattice

Father holding my hands

Gently walk by, early in the morning

Quiet stone road

I slowly fall asleep

Heaven just broke
